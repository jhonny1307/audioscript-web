# 🎧 Audio Script

**Audio Script** is a simple browser-based tool for recording segmented audio from a script and merging everything into a single file.

It was built as part of a challenge:

> *"Can AI replace a developer for this kind of tool?"*

Short answer: apparently… yes. Long answer: also yes, but with style.

## 🚀 Features

* ✂️ Split your script into multiple recording segments
* 🎙️ Record each segment individually
* 🔁 Re-record any segment with a single button
* 🧠 Automatic project loading (no manual load needed)
* 💾 Save everything locally using `localStorage`
* 🧹 Clear all saved data instantly
* 🧩 Support for inline comments using `//`

  * These appear as visual notes (not audio)

* ⏱️ Optional gap between segments

## 🧠 How to Use

1. Paste your script into the text box
2. Use `//` to add comments or directions:

   // pause here
   Line 3
   ```
3. Click **Split**
4. Record each segment
5. Click **Generate final audio**

## 💾 Saving System

* When you reopen the page, everything loads automatically
* No backend, no accounts, no tracking

There is no undo.
There is only regret.

This project was inspired by a simple idea:
